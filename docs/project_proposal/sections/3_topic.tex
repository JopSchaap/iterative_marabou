\section{Topic}
To let the technique work we require that we have at least one point for which the properties hold. Finding of this point is outside the scope of this report and I instead assume this starting point to be 0. For the project I want to create an algorithm as described below: 
 
\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{Iterative Marabou algorithm}\label{alg:cap}
\input{sections/psuedocode/iterative_reluplex.tex}
\end{algorithm}
